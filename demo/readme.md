#React-Bootstrap-Slider Demo

The JavaScript files need to be built before you can run this demo.  If there is no /demo/js folder present, then you need to run:
        npm run buildDemo
This will create the /demo/js folder and put the built JavaScript files in there.  You can then open /demo/index.html in your browser.
